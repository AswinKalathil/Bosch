Q: Why is Azure AI Search required for Custom Question Answering?
A: CQA uses Azure AI Search to store, index, and retrieve the question-answer data. The AI Search service handles fast semantic retrieval and ranking of answers before passing the top results to the Language model.

Q: How do I create a Custom Question Answering project?
A: In Azure AI Foundry or Language Studio, create a new project under Custom Question Answering, connect your Azure AI Language and Azure AI Search resources, upload Q&A documents (or a CSV file), and publish the knowledge base to get an endpoint and key.

Q: How can I deploy my CQA project?
A: After creating and testing your knowledge base, publish it in Language Studio. This generates an endpoint and key which you can use in your applications via REST API or Azure SDK.

Q: What is the pricing impact of using CQA?
A: You’ll be charged for both the Azure AI Language resource (based on usage) and Azure AI Search resource (based on selected tier, starting at $25/month).

Q: Can I use local or open-source alternatives to Azure AI Search?
A: Yes, you can simulate the retrieval part locally using vector stores like FAISS or ChromaDB and embedding models from HuggingFace. This approach works well for PoC or testing without incurring costs.
